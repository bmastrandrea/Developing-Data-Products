# Developing-Data-Products

This is the Course Project for the course Developing Data Products on Coursera.

I have created a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
Then, I have used Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about my application.

The Shiny App can be found at https://bmastrandrea.shinyapps.io/Shiny_app_USArrests/
